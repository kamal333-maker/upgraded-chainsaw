    <p>
      The <b>Beagle</b> is a breed of small hound that is similar in appearance to the larger foxhound. 
      The <i>Beagle</i> was developed primarily for hunting hare, known as beagling. 
      Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking instinct, 
      the Beagle is employed as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. 
      It is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and lack of inherited health problems.
